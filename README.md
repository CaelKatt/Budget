# My Budget Sheets / Configurations 
A repository featuring my google sheets budget templates. Don't hesitate to suggest ideas, they very well be added/I might have overlooked something. I heavily took inspiration/boilerplate from [vertex42](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/personal-monthly-budget.html)'s Personal Monthly Budget, however mine have been modernized + expanded upon in a variety of ways including (but not limited to): 

- Year Dashboard including checking and savings overviews
- Charts/At a glance ease of use
- Increased month to month analysis/breakdown of all aspects
- Fully featured subscriptions page
- Updated month categories/clean-up


### Prereqs
